# Maze

This plugin emulate a parkour game where you have a starting position and an end position.
The players are put in the same area all in once and are timed on their performances.

Here's a road map of the future feature that are yet to be implemented.

- [x] Waitrooms (Area where players wait before the race to complete a parkour ends)
- [x] Possibility to join the game via command and or signs
- [ ] Warp pads blocks in the maze.  
- [ ] Adding economy feature to reward players performance
- [ ] Maze generator. (Make it possible to generate custom mazes)
- [ ] Changing maze. (Make a maze change its layout in each unique round, so players would have to find a new path each time)

## Contribution
I don't have much organisation when it comes to contribution. Just put and issue in the [Github issues](https://github.com/Benliam12/Maze/issues)
section and make a pull request onto it. I'll do my best to review your code as soon as I can. Please make
multiple pull request if you wish to implement multiple features as this will be easier on my end to review your work.
